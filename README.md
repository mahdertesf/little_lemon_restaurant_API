# Little Lemon API üçã


## Project Description

This project involves creating a fully functional API for the Little Lemon restaurant. The API will allow client application developers to build web and mobile applications that can interact with the restaurant's data. The API will support various user roles, including customers, managers, and delivery crew, each with different levels of access and permissions.

### Key Features

- **User Registration and Token Generation**: Users can register, log in, and obtain access tokens for authenticated API requests.
- **Menu Management**: Managers can add, update, and delete menu items. Customers and delivery crew can view menu items.
- **User Group Management**: Managers can assign users to the manager or delivery crew groups.
- **Cart Management**: Customers can add items to their cart, view their cart, and delete items from their cart.
- **Order Management**: Customers can place orders, view their orders, and managers can update order status and assign delivery crew.
- **Filtering, Pagination, and Sorting**: The API supports filtering, pagination, and sorting for menu items and orders.
- **Throttling**: The API implements throttling to limit the number of requests from authenticated and unauthenticated users.
